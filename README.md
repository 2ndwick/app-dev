## My All Time Favorite Dialogue
### Big Daddy Dialogue
**Layla:** 
*I'm sorry Sonny, I cant. It's my case*

**Sonny:**
*What about Julian's case? We don't even know where this kid's gonna end up.*

**Layla:**
*Sonny, this is exactly why I didn't want to get involved. I had things going just the way I wanted. And then I'm sitting in the park, and you and this kid just come barging into my life. And it's screwing up everything I had planned.*

**Sonny**
*A kid showed up on my doorstep. You think I planned on that? But I fell in love with him*.
